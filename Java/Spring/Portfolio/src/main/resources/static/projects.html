	    	<p>The goal with this site was to create a blend of east and west. They wanted it to represent Indian weddings, but still be all-inclusive. We kept things simple and focused on content so that their wedding videos could take center stage.</p>

	    	<p>ONE is a development located in the heart of Greenville, South Carolina. Their goal for the website was to create something fresh that would show off their city and help out-of-towners to discover this neat town and hopefully decide to bring their stores to the development.</p>

	    	<p>One of the main functions of this site was to help visitors develop a comfort level with the professional, fun, and educational environment of the school. We worked together to create a design that was beautiful as well as functional.</p>
