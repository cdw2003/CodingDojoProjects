1: This code would have the output "undefined" because the variable would be declared and called in the function before it is assigned.

2: This would output "magnet" because the command to print comes inside the function, where the variable is assigned to the word "magnet".

3: In this case, the code would output "super cool" because the print command is outside the function and the variable is defined outside the function as "super cool".

4: This code would first print the word "chicken" outside the function, then when the function runs, it would print "half-chicken" because the variable declaration would rise to the top of the function, then it would be assigned to "half-chicken", then it would print.  The re-assignment to "gone" would only happen after the variable has printed.

5: Mean is a variable that has been assigned to the output of a function, but is not a function itself, so the output of this code will be an error.  Further, the variable "food" has not been defined or assigned outside of the function so it can't be called outside of the function.

6: The first output would be "undefined" because the variable will be declared at the top before the print statement, but will not be assigned until after the print statement.  Then when the function is called, the variable is first assigned to "rock", and that will be printed.  Then, it is assigned to "r&b" and that will be printed.  Then, outside the function, the global variable will be called, which has been assigned to "disco", so "disco" will be printed last.

7: "San Jose" will be printed first because it is assigned to the global variable, which is printed before the function is called.  Then, in the function, "Seattle" is printed first and then "Burbank".  Then, outside the function, the global variable is called, so "San Jose" is printed again.
